## Introduction

### Objective

The objective for this project was to produce a CRUD application (Create, Read, Update and Delete) using tools that have been taught to us throughout this course;
* Use the AGILE planning method.
* Create a database containing a 1 to many relationship.
* Use Python te create a fuctional CRUD application.
* Integrate the use of both a VCS and a CI server.
* Provide coverage for the app using testing.
* Deploy the app using a cloud-based VM, GCP in this case.

### Proposal

In order to meet the requirements set out within the objectives and the brief, I decided to begin designing an app where you can enter a team name and list of players in order to form your dream football team. In creating a team you will be entering:
* A team name.
* The team league.
* A player name.
* The player nationality.
* The player position.

This proposal showed potential to be able to execute the proposed CRUD functionality and therefore I decided to carry out the application idea.

## Architecture

### Entity-Relationship Diagram(ERD)

The ERD that I created for my project shows the relationship between both teams and players and shows how a team can have many diferent players and for this to work in terms of using a primary key and a foreign key, the foreign key must be stored within the players table.

### Risk Assessment

Below are 2 versions of my risk assessment, the first one being an initial risk assessment and the 2nd being a follow up in which the impact levels and likeliness have been edited to show the impact having a risk assessment has made in ensuring that I am cautious of any potential risks.

### Trello

I used Trello in order to track my project, in terms of using the AGILE planning method, Trello was very useful in keeping me on schedule and it also allowed me to refine my objectives over time and branch them out into more detailed sub classes within the Trello. Using Trello to track my project allowed me to identify what the project required each step of the way.
